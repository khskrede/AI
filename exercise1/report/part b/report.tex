\subsection*{Problem representation}

\subsubsection*{Genotypes and phenotypes}

The genotype is represented as an array of $B*S$ boolean values (where $S$ is the number of available
soldiers and $B$ is the number of battles.) The genotype was chosen such that no genes would be "worth"
more soldiers than others.

A restriction is set on the genotype to contain exactly $S$ true values. The genotype is initialized 
such that each boolean of the genotype has a probability of $1/B$Â chance of being true.

The phenotype is represented as an array of $B$ integers. These integers represent how many troops 
the colonel shows up with at each battle.

\subsubsection*{Crossover}

The crossover is done by finding all places where in the genotype array individual 1 is true and individual 2 is not.
And then finding all places where in the genotype array individual 2 is true and individual 1 is not. Then using this
information to randomly construct a bit-mask to be used in the crossover.

\subsubsection*{Mutation}

Mutation is done by selecting two random places in the genotype that has different values, and switching places.
This guarantees that there will still be $S$ troops.

\subsubsection*{Evaluation}

The evaluation is done exactly as proposed by the assignment.

\subsubsection*{Strategy entropy}

The average strategy entropy is calculated as proposed by the assignment and plotted along with the 
fitness plots.

\subsection*{EA settings}

The settings used for all ea runs:\\
\\
Size of child pool: 30\\
Size of adult pool: 30\\
number of generations: 200\\
mutation rate: 1\\
crossover rate: 0.9\\
selection protocol: Full generational replacement\\
selection strategy: Sigma scaling\\
elitism: 2\\

\subsection*{descriptions of the 3 signature cases}

All the runs resulted in converging results.
Don't have time to add fintess plots. The plots for
all runs are included in a zip file.
The plots are named {B-Rf-Lf}.png, they should correspond
to the table above.
